DMSP SSM NASA CDF Tools

This repository includes tools and information about the data from the Magnetometer (SSM) instrument 
aboard the Defense Meteorolgy Satellite Program spacecraft.

Specificially, it is a companion to the DMSP SSM CDF files which were prepared as part of NASA grant (#####) 
for inclusion in the [CDAWeb](http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp_public/) Virtual Observatory.

These tools are written in the Python language, and it is assumed that users have installed [spacepy](http://spacepy.lanl.gov/index.shtml)
and the [NASA CDF library](http://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/sw_and_docs.html). 
These packages provide the tools nessecary to read the CDF format data available from CDAWeb.

To read details about the instrument and our files, visit the [DMSP NOAA NCEI (Formerly NGDC) Documentation](http://satdat.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/docs/)

A draft version of the User Manual including the SSM instrument is also available in the repo. 
This document will tell you what to watch out for so you don't comprimise your analysis, so it's worth reading.
